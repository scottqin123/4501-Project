This is the final project for IEOR 4501: Tools for Analytics. In this project, we use yellow taxi, Uber, hourly weather and daily weather data to make connections and understandings from 2009 to June 2015. There are four parts to the project: data processing, data storing in SQL, data querying in SQL to answer preassigned questions, and data visualization to answer preassigned questions. Each of these parts are designated in the Jupyter notebook file "code.ipynb."
